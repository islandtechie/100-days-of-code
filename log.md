**Today's Progress**: Started Learning React. Thinking about a project i want build.

**Thoughts:** I really struggle with staying consist with learning web development. I am a part of a prgoram and I have not taken advanatge of the great opportunity. I really want to be a developer. I can not depend on others to make me it. I have to become it. The most difficult part is always having to relearn but im done with that. I must push myself. I will push myself. 100 Days of code!
